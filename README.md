# Business Card by Bohdan Yereshchenko

This is my business card website repository created to be hired for the dream job. `You're able to use this template for your own purposes :)`

## Routes

This website contains two routes:
1. `Home` - home page of the website. Contains couple links to my social medias and rout "resume".
2. `Resume` - resume page of the website. Contains my language skills, technical skills, "about" info and my `projects list`

## Bug connected with React Router

As the website author, I have to tell you that you shouldn't hit `<-` or `->` arrows in the browser, because this would lead to a bug connected with React Router in the GH Pages. But you should move through the pages by clicking `navigation links`.
